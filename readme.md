Hello World ðŸ‘¾


In this repository you will find how to build Python data science skills. we will see iterators, list comprehensions, and apply data manipulation skills, which are extremely handy tools for all data scientists working in Python.

There are tons of fantastic functions in Python and its library ecosystem. we will constantly need to write our own functions to solve problems that are dictated by data. You will see function writing in this repository, how to write your very own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in your function writing.
